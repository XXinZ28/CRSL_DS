# CRSL_DS
My name is Xinxin Zhang, a Smith College undergraduate student majoring in Statistical Data Science and minoring in Psychology. My interests lie in the field of data and society, as well as digital culture and humanities. I am an intern at the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life (CRSL) at Smith College, where I conduct research to understand the satisfaction extent of students with their program.

The qmd. file  provide a step-by-step explanation of the analysis of program attendance in CRSL, which is one part of the broader research on CRSL's program satisfaction.
